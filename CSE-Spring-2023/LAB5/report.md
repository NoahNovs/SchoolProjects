Phase 1:

I was going through the steps to using r2, so I opened bomb with "$ r2 -e asm.syntax=att -Ad bomb". I would then set the breaking point to sym.phase_1, and then I would go through the process until the breaking point was reached. I would then use pdf, adn then I saw that "leaq" had a string, and I would put that in to defuse phase 1. It was "I was trying to give Tina Fey more material."

Phase 2:
I first noticed that you needed 6 numbers, so I started with 1-6. I went through the function, and noticed that you needed to start with 0, so I did 0-5. 0-2 worked fine through each iteration of the loop, and then I started to guess first the fourth number, which was 6. I then analyzed the code to see that the pattern was adding the previous two numbers, and you would multiply the sum by 2. This worked at the end.
